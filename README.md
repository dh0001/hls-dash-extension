# HLS and DASH Playback

HLS and DASH playback in browsers

This extension redirects m3u8 and mpd files to extension pages embedding [hls.js][] and [dash.js][], and attempts to play the file using those libraries.

Clicking on the icon opens a menu where you can:

  * Toggle redirect behavior, allowing m3u8 and mpd files to be downloaded normally.
  * Toggle zoom, changing if the video should be resized to fit the screen.

[hls.js]: https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js
[dash.js]: https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js
